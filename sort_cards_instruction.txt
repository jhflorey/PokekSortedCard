CODE EXERCISE INSTRUCTIONS

Create a small program in JavaScript language that will sort a deck of cards. The cards will be given to you in a random order and you are to sort the cards two through ace within the suit and then the suits in diamond, spades, clubs, hearts order.

The cards are represented as string in the following format:

2d - two of diamonds

3d - three of diamonds

...

10d - ten of diamonds

Jd - jack of diamonds

Qd - queen of diamonds

Kd - king of diamonds

Ad - ace of diamonds

d - diamonds

s - spades

c - clubs

h – hearts

The cards will be given to you as a list of strings, e.g. in C# it would be List<String> cards = new List<String> { "3c", "Js", "2d", "10h", "Kh", "8s", "Ac", "4h"}. You are welcome to either hardcode the input into the code itself or take in the input as command parameters/args.

In the end, the output of the sorted cards will be “2d, 8s, Js, 3c, Ac, 4h, 10h, Kh”.
